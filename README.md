# NGO Helper
A Flutter App for the community.

_NGOs help the world, this app will help NGOs_

## Motivation
Considering the socio-economic status of 138 crore population of our country, NGO’s in India have been rampantly working towards upliftment of social voids, generating awareness and acting as torch bearers lighting people’s lives. All they need are volunteers and support from the privileged one’s and these volunteers act as a backbone of any Non-profit organizations. Our application acts as an intermediary between an NGO and an individual willing to volunteer and contribute, thus easing out connectivity and accessibility.

But sometimes there aren't enough volunteers, or let's say th NGO wants to conduct a program out of it's hometown. In such a case, they would definitely need all the help they can get.

The locals in the town can help the NGO to coordinate their programs. But how?

That's where our app - NGO Helper comes in.

NGO Helper is built to provide a platform to all the NGOs and social workers, where they can connect with each other and work towards a common goal.
