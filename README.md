# NGO Helper
A Flutter App for the NGO community.

_NGOs help the world, this app will help NGOs_

## MOTIVATION

In Indian context wherein people are still steeped in superstition, faith, belief and custom, NGOs act as catalysts and create awareness among people. They focus on all the issues concerning human rights, social, environmental and advocacy. Considering the socio-economic status of 138 crore population of our country, NGO’s in India have been rampantly working towards upliftment of social voids, generating awareness and acting as torch bearers lighting people’s lives. All they need are volunteers and support from the privileged one’s and these volunteers act as a backbone of any Non-profit organizations. Our application acts as an intermediary between an NGO and an individual willing to volunteer and contribute, thus easing out connectivity and accessibility.

But sometimes there aren't enough volunteers, or let's say the NGO wants to conduct a program out of it's hometown. In such a case, they would definitely need all the help they can get.

The locals in the town can help the NGO to coordinate their programs. But how?

That's where our app - NGO Helper comes in.

NGO Helper is built to provide a platform to all the NGOs and social workers, where they can connect with each other and work towards a common goal.

## PROPOSED SOLUTION
The App asks user to register giving them options to login as an organizer or a volunteer. It first lists down the NGOs at a particular location giving access to two types of users of our app i.e,
1.	Organiser
2.	Volunteer

It then redirects them to the respective secure pages.

Organizer:  An Organizer gets in to browse the details of a particular NGO along with the details of the point of contact. The Organizer gets access to create, edit and update personal credentials as well as manage the various event information about his/her NGO.

Volunteer:  Volunteers who wish to work for the NGO can browse the information about different NGOs listed in sorted manner according to the location. They are provided with two features chat support/helpdesk, this helps them to resolve any kind of queries.

Contributor: This feature allows the volunteer to fill in the personal details and register themselves for the volunteership program with the respective NGO of their choice.

## APPLICATION AND FUTURE SCOPE
Our app bridges the gap between the good Samaritans and the Non-Profitable Organisation. The Organizers can post important events regarding their organization and willing individuals can take initiative for volunteership. The app is yet to be modified to be used in a broader spectrum.

We wish to further work on improvising our app, add some advanced features like enabling chat and video features , able to donate money and materials, thus making it more flexible. Further, we plan to use our app as a medium between local NGOs and volunteers, so that it can be widely used for serving the purpose. We aim to associate our app with the National Service Scheme(NSS) group at our University who will be responsible for testing and providing us with improved scalability thus making our app ready for a robust launch to be service-ready.

This application is definitely going to help the NGOs to keep the interested volunteers updated about the upcoming events and connect with the contributors , thus by heading towards a more better charitable society.
